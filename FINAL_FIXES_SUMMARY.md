# Final Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Active Game Screen - Overlay Issue Fixed
**Problem**: The Padel Match card had overlapping elements and text clashing

**Solution**:
- Reduced all padding and margins throughout the card
- Made status badge `flex-shrink-0` to prevent wrapping
- Changed player avatars from 9x9 to 8x8
- Reduced button padding from `py-2` to `py-1.5`
- Added `truncate` to location text
- Adjusted spacing between all sections (mb-2 instead of mb-3)
- Card now fits perfectly without any overlapping

### 2. ✅ Replaced "Your Stats Today" Section
**Problem**: Stats section wasn't relevant to the active game context

**Solution**: Replaced with "Game Details" section showing:
- **Court Type**: Indoor Padel
- **Duration**: 90 minutes
- **Price per player**: $15.00
- **Equipment Included**: Rackets and balls provided (with Zap icon)

More contextual and useful information for the active game.

### 3. ✅ Messages Screen - Now Actual Conversation
**Problem**: Messages screen showed list of contacts, not actual messages

**Solution**: Complete redesign to show real conversation:
- **Chat header** with Maria G. profile
  - Back button (ChevronRight rotated)
  - Avatar
  - "Active now" status
  - Group icon button
- **Conversation bubbles**:
  - 5 messages alternating between sender and receiver
  - Green gradient bubbles for "me" (right-aligned, rounded-br-sm)
  - Glass bubbles for "them" (left-aligned, rounded-bl-sm)
  - Timestamps below each message
  - Smooth animations on load
- **Message input** at bottom:
  - Text input field
  - Send button with green gradient
  - Proper spacing from bottom

### 4. ✅ Notifications Screen - Bottom Cutoff Fixed
**Problem**: Last notification card was cut off at the bottom

**Solution**:
- Changed `bottom-16` to `bottom-4`
- Added `pb-12` padding to the container
- All 5 notifications now fully visible
- Proper spacing maintained
