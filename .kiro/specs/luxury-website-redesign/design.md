# Design Document

## Overview

This design document outlines the transformation of the PlayCenter website from its current basic appearance to a luxury, modern, and sophisticated design. The redesign focuses on creating a premium user experience through clean aesthetics, refined typography, and cohesive visual language while maintaining the existing hero section and header components.

The design philosophy centers on "luxury through simplicity" - achieving premium appeal through careful attention to spacing, typography, contrast, and subtle details rather than ornate decorations or complex visual effects.

## Architecture

### Design System Foundation

The redesign is built on a comprehensive design system that ensures consistency across all components and pages:

**Color System:**
- Primary: Pure black (#000000) and pure white (#ffffff)
- Grays: Carefully selected gray scale from #f8f9fa to #212529
- Accent: Minimal use of single accent color for critical actions only
- Transparency: Strategic use of opacity for layering and hierarchy

**Typography Scale:**
- Font Family: Geist Sans (existing) for clean, modern appearance
- Scale: 12px, 14px, 16px, 18px, 20px, 24px, 32px, 48px, 64px, 80px
- Weights: 400 (regular), 500 (medium), 600 (semibold), 700 (bold)
- Line Heights: 1.2 for headings, 1.5 for body text, 1.4 for UI elements

**Spacing System:**
- Base unit: 4px
- Scale: 4px, 8px, 12px, 16px, 24px, 32px, 48px, 64px, 96px, 128px
- Consistent application across margins, padding, and gaps

**Border Radius:**
- Small: 4px (buttons, small cards)
- Medium: 8px (cards, inputs)
- Large: 12px (major containers)
- Extra Large: 16px (hero elements, major sections)
