# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for completely rebuilding the PlayCircle website header component to achieve full transparency while maintaining the existing smooth animations and functionality. The rebuild will replace the current semi-transparent header with a fully transparent design that provides better visual integration with the background content while preserving all interactive features and animations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want a fully transparent header that doesn't obstruct the background content, so that I can enjoy an unobstructed view of the hero section and page content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits any page THEN the header SHALL be completely transparent with no background color or blur effects
2. WHEN a user scrolls the page THEN the header SHALL remain transparent throughout the entire scroll experience
3. WHEN a user views the header THEN it SHALL not create any visual barrier between the user and the background content
4. IF the header overlays content THEN the text and elements SHALL remain clearly readable through proper contrast techniques

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the header text and elements to remain clearly visible against any background, so that I can always access navigation and branding elements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the header overlays light backgrounds THEN text and elements SHALL use dark colors for proper contrast
2. WHEN the header overlays dark backgrounds THEN text and elements SHALL use light colors for proper contrast
3. WHEN the header overlays complex backgrounds THEN text SHALL have appropriate shadows, outlines, or other contrast enhancement techniques
4. IF background content changes THEN header text visibility SHALL adapt automatically or remain consistently readable

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want all existing header animations to be preserved, so that the interactive experience remains smooth and engaging.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the page loads THEN the logo animation SHALL execute with the same spring animation and timing
2. WHEN the page loads THEN the PlayCircle text SHALL animate in with the same slide and fade effect
3. WHEN the page loads THEN the navigation menu SHALL animate in with the same timing and easing
4. WHEN the page loads THEN the download button and mobile menu button SHALL animate in with the same effects
5. WHEN a user interacts with animated elements THEN hover states and transitions SHALL maintain the same smooth behavior

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want the mobile menu functionality to work exactly as before, so that I can access all navigation options seamlessly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens the mobile menu THEN the overlay and sidebar SHALL appear with the same animations and styling
2. WHEN the mobile menu is open THEN the backdrop blur and positioning SHALL work identically to the current implementation
3. WHEN a user closes the mobile menu THEN the exit animation SHALL be identical to the current behavior
4. WHEN a user interacts with mobile menu items THEN the touch interactions and navigation SHALL function exactly as before

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the header layout and positioning to remain identical, so that the familiar interface is preserved while gaining transparency benefits.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views the header THEN the logo, navigation, and buttons SHALL be positioned exactly as in the current design
2. WHEN a user views the header on different screen sizes THEN the responsive behavior SHALL match the current implementation
3. WHEN a user interacts with header elements THEN the spacing, sizing, and alignment SHALL be identical to the current design
4. IF the header needs structural changes THEN they SHALL be minimal and focused only on achieving transparency

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the header to maintain its fixed positioning behavior, so that navigation remains accessible while scrolling.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user scrolls the page THEN the header SHALL remain fixed at the top of the viewport
2. WHEN a user scrolls quickly THEN the header SHALL not lag or create visual artifacts
3. WHEN a user reaches different scroll positions THEN the header SHALL maintain its transparent appearance
4. IF scroll behavior affects header visibility THEN appropriate contrast measures SHALL ensure continued usability

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the header component to be performant and maintainable, so that the transparency doesn't impact site performance or code quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the header renders THEN it SHALL not cause performance degradation compared to the current implementation
2. WHEN the component updates THEN re-renders SHALL be optimized and not cause unnecessary calculations
3. WHEN maintaining the code THEN the component structure SHALL remain clean and well-organized
4. IF performance monitoring is conducted THEN the transparent header SHALL not negatively impact Core Web Vitals

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want the transparent header to maintain all accessibility features, so that I can navigate the site effectively regardless of my abilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using keyboard navigation THEN focus indicators SHALL be clearly visible against any background
2. WHEN using screen readers THEN all header elements SHALL remain properly labeled and accessible
3. WHEN viewing with high contrast settings THEN the header SHALL adapt appropriately to maintain usability
4. IF color contrast is insufficient THEN additional techniques SHALL be employed to ensure WCAG compliance

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a user, I want smooth transitions when the header adapts to different backgrounds, so that the experience feels polished and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN header text color changes for contrast THEN transitions SHALL be smooth and not jarring
2. WHEN hover states activate THEN they SHALL work seamlessly with the transparent background
3. WHEN animations play THEN they SHALL not conflict with the transparency effects
4. IF visual adjustments are needed THEN they SHALL happen smoothly without disrupting the user experience

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a user on different devices and browsers, I want the transparent header to work consistently, so that I have a reliable experience regardless of my platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing on different browsers THEN the transparency SHALL render consistently across Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
2. WHEN viewing on mobile devices THEN the transparent header SHALL work properly on iOS and Android browsers
3. WHEN viewing on different screen densities THEN the header SHALL maintain proper contrast and readability
4. IF browser limitations exist THEN graceful fallbacks SHALL ensure the header remains functional and attractive
